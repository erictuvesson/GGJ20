# GGJ20
Jam Game made for [GGJ 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/)

This was a game that was developed in less than 24 hours as I was rather busy that weekend with other things.

## Things I learnt:
* AirConsole, never heard of it before GGJ as it was a sponsor. I am quit happy with how it worked out, had some technical difficulties as it didn't work on the jam site's internet (firewall issues).
